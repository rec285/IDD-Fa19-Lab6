# ChatBot

*A lab report by Ryan Curtis*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I modified the chat bot to tell Knock Knock jokes in the format of:

```
Bot: "Knock Knock"
User: "Who's there?"
Bot: X
Bot: "?"
User: X + "who?"
Bot: Punchline
```

If the user enters the incorrect response, the bot will prompt the user again until they follow the correct Knock Knock joke format. I also edited the css file to change the color scheme and made the response time shorter so the user doesn't have to wait as long for the jokes.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
